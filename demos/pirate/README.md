# The Cursed Pirate

The Cursed Pirate Demo was originally ~made~ hastily thrown together in about 5 hours for the first [talk that featured / introduced Indigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZETGZKCVU). The idea was to put together something memorable - not a game - just a small, fun demo.

This version is almost a total rebuild.

Indigo had already changed enormously between the talk in Jan 2020 and the first release in June 2020, and has evolved further since.

So one reason for the rebuild was simply to bring it up to date, the other was that it wasn't a good example of how to build a game. The original version took many shortcuts, focusing on showing off some of the features of Indigo to an audience, via a happy path, rather than worrying about being a reasonable example of how one might build a game.

Hopefully this version is a better example for people looking for inspiration.

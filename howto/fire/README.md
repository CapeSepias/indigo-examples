# Fire Shader

This is the companion repo to the ["How to write a fire shader"](https://indigoengine.io/docs/guides/howto-fire-shader) guide.

This demo was made using [Mill](https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/mill/mill/Intro_to_Mill.html), but would work fine converted to sbt.

If you have Mill and Electron installed (`npm install -g electron`), you can run the demo with:

```sh
mill fire.runGame
```
